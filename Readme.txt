I found that the -develop branch led to an error that it was missing a folder in "application/errors/..."
and apparently, according to:
	- http://www.codeigniter.com/download - "CodeIgniter_2.2.0" is the latest stable version
	- the CodeIgniter 3 user guide, there is a link "CodeIgniter v3.0.0 (Current version)" that leads to "CodeIgniter_2.2.0.zip"
So, I am assuming that this is what is referred to as CodeIgniter 3.
